# ReduxSagaShop

React Native Redux Saga Project

This is a sample React Native project demonstrating the implementation of Redux and Redux Saga for state management and handling asynchronous operations. The app serves as a basic e-commerce shopping application, allowing users to browse and add/remove products to/from their shopping cart. The Redux store manages the cart data, and Redux Saga handles the asynchronous fetching of users list from an external API.
